# Password-Generator

## Description 

The task that I was given was to create a functional password generator. The client wants a website that can generate a strong password for whenever they need to protect sensitive data. They request the following for theiri password generator.

Given a user requires a new secure password,
1. When the user click the button to generate a password, a series of prompts is presented for password criteria
2. The user is required to enter the number of characters they wish their password to be. The number is between 8 and 128.
3. The user is asked to choose one or more of the following criteria: lowercase, uppercase, number, and/or special characters.
4. The password generated is displayed on the page.

The Password Generator website looks like:

In this project, I used javascript to code the password generator.
